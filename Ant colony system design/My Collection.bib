abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms have been applied to a variety of network flow problems with acceptable results. In this research, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is used to solve a variation of the multicommodity capacitated network design problem (MCNDP). This variation represents a hybrid communication network as found in network centric models with multiple objectives including costs, delays, robustness, vulnerability, and reliability. Nodes in such centric systems can have multiple and varying link capacities, rates and information (commodity) quantities to be delivered and received. Each commodity can have an independent prioritized bandwidth requirement as well. Insight to the MCNDP problem domain and Pareto structure is developed. The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is modified and extended to solve such a MCNDP. Since the MCNDP is highly constrained, a novel initialization procedure and mutation method are also integrated into this MOEA. Empirical results and analysis indicate that effective solutions are generated very efficiently},

abstract = {Ant System, the first Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, showed to be a viable method for attacking hard combinatorial optimization problems. Yet, its performance, when compared to more fine-tuned algorithms, was rather poor for large instances of traditional benchmark problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem. To show that Ant Colony Optimization algorithms could be good alternatives to existing algorithms for hard combinatorial optimization problems, recent research in this area has mainly focused on the development of algorithmic variants which achieve better performance than Ant System. In this paper, we present MAX-MIN Ant System (MMAS), an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm derived from Ant System. MMAS differs from Ant System in several important aspects, whose usefulness we demonstrate by means of an experimental study. Additionally, we relate one of the characteristics specific to MMAS - that of using a greedier search than Ant System - to results from the search space analysis of the combinatorial optimization problems attacked in this paper. Our computational results on the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Quadratic Assignment Problem show that MMAS is currently among the best performing algorithms for these problems.},

@phdthesis{VanOers2011,
abstract = {Naval architects often say that every ship is a compromise between many conflicting requirements. This widely-held belief immediately raises the question as to what kind of ship and, therefore, what kind of compromise, would suit the ship owner’s interest best. The approach presented in this thesis aims to improve the early stage design process of service vessels by helping the naval architect to generate and explore a large and diverse set of three-dimensional ship designs. In turn, this set enables the thorough investigation of a wide range of different compromises before settling upon a well-founded –and a more competitive- ship design that reflects the most promising compromise and, as such, will be deemed desirable by its owner. The approach has four key features. Firstly, it uses a novel parametric ship description (based on `packing problems’) that can handle large and concurrent changes to the entire three-dimensional ship design, i.e., hull, superstructure, decks, bulkheads and the arrangement of systems in the ship can all change without human interaction. Secondly, it uses a search algorithm to generate a large and diverse set of ship designs that reflect a wide range of different compromises. Thirdly, the naval architect considers all feasible designs to gain insight in conflicting characteristics before selecting the most promising ship designs in a transparent manner. The selection can be based on objective and constraint values, as well as on the naval architect’s own engineering judgement. Fourthly, the naval architect takes all selection decisions to help instil the crucial sense of ownership for the ship designs that result from the selection process. This novel design approach has been applied successfully to design two types of service vessels: deep water drillships and frigates. It proved able to establish the design impact of variations in payload and performance requirements. Moreover, the resulting set of designs was subsequently used to illustrate how the naval architect can identify and select designs that excel at particular performances, such as sea-keeping. In summary, the approach is expected to improve the naval architect’s ability to identify promising ship designs early on, which should lead to the design of more competitive service vessels.},

abstract = {For monitoring burst events in a kind of reactive wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a multipath routing protocol (MRP) based on dynamic clustering and ant colony optimization (ACO) is proposed.. Such an approach can maximize the network lifetime and reduce the energy consumption. An important attribute of WSNs is their limited power supply, and therefore some metrics (such as energy consumption of communication among nodes, residual energy, path length) were considered as very important criteria while designing routing in the MRP. Firstly, a cluster head (CH) is selected among nodes located in the event area according to some parameters, such as residual energy. Secondly, an improved ACO algorithm is applied in the search for multiple paths between the CH and sink node. Finally, the CH dynamically chooses a route to transmit data with a probability that depends on many path metrics, such as energy consumption. The simulation results show that MRP can prolong the network lifetime, as well as balance of energy consumption among nodes and reduce the average energy consumption effectively.},
