In analogy to the biological example, ACO is based on the indirect communication of a colony of simple agents, called (artificial) ants, mediated by (artificial) pheromone trails. The pheromone trails in ACO serve as a distributed, numerical information which the ants use to probabilistically construct solutions to the problem being solved and which the ants adapt during the algorithm's execution to reflect their search experience.

abstract = {Generating ship arrangements is inherently a problem of identifying the spatial regions to be occupied by shipboard elements while balancing the impact on performance. Traditionally, elements are assigned a Cartesian coordinate location, and the allocation problem is solved in three-dimensional space. The coordinates for each subsequent element are selected by considering the element's interactions with placed and yet-to-be-placed elements. This paper presents a new approach to ship arrangements that starts with a non-spatial, network theory-based perspective and results in the traditional assignment of shipboard items to designated structural zones. Network partitioning is used to identify groups of mutually compatible ship elements, termed communities. A metric is introduced to express each community's cumulative preference to be located in specified regions of the ship. The cumulative preferences are used in a direct community-to-structural zone seeding procedure that creates reasonable initial compartment allocations. The rudimentary design knowledge required to position a particular set of shipboard elements using the proposed methods is ideally suited to early-stage design processes. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this research, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is used to solve a variation of the multicommodity capacitated network design problem (MCNDP). This variation represents a hybrid communication network as found in network centric models with multiple objectives including costs, delays, robustness, vulnerability, and reliability. Nodes in such centric systems can have multiple and varying link capacities, rates and information (commodity) quantities to be delivered and received. Each commodity can have an independent prioritized bandwidth requirement as well. Insight to the MCNDP problem domain and Pareto structure is developed. The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is modified and extended to solve such a MCNDP. Since the MCNDP is highly constrained, a novel initialization procedure and mutation method are also integrated into this MOEA. Empirical results and analysis indicate that effective solutions are generated very efficiently},

In real-world complex systems, a node's degree for one type of links and that for the other are not randomly distributed but correlated, which we term correlated multiplexity. In this paper we study a simple model of multiplex random networks and demonstrate that the correlated multiplexity can drastically affect the properties of giant component in the network. Specifically, when the degrees of a node for different interactions in a duplex Erdos-Renyi network are maximally correlated, the network contains the giant component for any nonzero link densities. On the contrary, when the degrees of a node are maximally anti-correlated, the emergence of giant component is significantly delayed, yet the entire network becomes connected into a single component at a finite link density. We also discuss the mixing patterns and the cases with imperfect correlated multiplexity.},

It is shown that the pure ACO approach can outperform some existing solution methods, whereas the hybrid approach can compete with the best known solution methods.

abstract = {Interconnected networks have been shown to be much more vulnerable to random and targeted failures than isolated ones, raising several interesting questions regarding the identification and mitigation of their risk. The paradigm to address these questions is the percolation model, where the resilience of the system is quantified by the dependence of the size of the largest cluster on the number of failures. Numerically, the major challenge is the identification of this cluster and the calculation of its size. Here, we propose an efficient algorithm to tackle this problem. We show that the algorithm scales as O(NlogN), where N is the number of nodes in the network, a significant improvement compared to O(N(2)) for a greedy algorithm, which permits studying much larger networks. Our new strategy can be applied to any network topology and distribution of interdependencies, as well as any sequence of failures.},

abstract = {In nature and technology, network-like systems are typically coupled and the resilience of one is affected by the others. The failure of a small fraction of elements in the system may have catastrophic effects, by triggering a cascade of events which drastically affects the global connectivity. We show that by choosing the proper autonomous nodes, catastrophic cascading failures can be avoided. We reveal that, when a small optimal fraction of autonomous nodes (about 10{\%}) is properly selected the nature of the percolation transition changes from discontinuous to continuous and the robustness of the system is significantly improved. This is in contrast to random selection where close to 50{\%} of autonomous nodes are needed. Surprisingly, even for coupled Poissonian type networks, where the variety between the node degrees is small, the proper choice of autonomous nodes leads to a large improvement.},

abstract = {In recent years network-scientific methods have seen increased use in ship design. Typically, when creating networks for use in design, a spatial representation is used. In this representation, major entities like spaces or pieces of equipment are considered nodes and then the connections between them, be they passageways or pipes or electrical wires, are denoted as edges. This paper introduces an alternate way of encoding ship design features in a network, called the " information dual. " This representation considers major paths as nodes and the entities at the intersections between the major paths as edges. The information dual representation provides ship designers with another tool to analyze the structure and complexity of various systems. This paper will provide the necessary background on network theory in ship design as well as the creation of the informational dual. Following that a series representative networks will be analyzed in both their spatial form and dual form. The paper will conclude with a discussion of the validity and applicability of the informational dual representation to commercial and naval ship design and highlight avenues for potential future research.},

abstract = {Ant System, the first Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, showed to be a viable method for attacking hard combinatorial optimization problems. Yet, its performance, when compared to more fine-tuned algorithms, was rather poor for large instances of traditional benchmark problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem. To show that Ant Colony Optimization algorithms could be good alternatives to existing algorithms for hard combinatorial optimization problems, recent research in this area has mainly focused on the development of algorithmic variants which achieve better performance than Ant System. In this paper, we present MAX-MIN Ant System (MMAS), an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm derived from Ant System. MMAS differs from Ant System in several important aspects, whose usefulness we demonstrate by means of an experimental study. Additionally, we relate one of the characteristics specific to MMAS - that of using a greedier search than Ant System - to results from the search space analysis of the combinatorial optimization problems attacked in this paper. Our computational results on the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Quadratic Assignment Problem show that MMAS is currently among the best performing algorithms for these problems.},

abstract = {It is important that our vital networks (e.g., infrastructures) are robust to more than single-link failures. Failures might for instance affect a part of the network that resides in a certain geographical region. In this paper, considering networks embedded in a two-dimensional plane, we study the problem of finding a critical region - that is, a part of the network that can be enclosed by a given elementary figure (a circle, ellipse, rectangle, square, or equilateral triangle) with a predetermined size - whose removal would lead to the highest network disruption. We determine that there is a polynomial number of non-trivial positions for such a figure that need to be considered and, subsequently, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem. Simulations on realistic networks illustrate that different figures with equal area result in different critical regions in a network. View full abstract},

abstract = {Naval architects often say that every ship is a compromise between many conflicting requirements. This widely-held belief immediately raises the question as to what kind of ship and, therefore, what kind of compromise, would suit the ship owner's interest best. The approach presented in this thesis aims to improve the early stage design process of service vessels by helping the naval architect to generate and explore a large and diverse set of three-dimensional ship designs. In turn, this set enables the thorough investigation of a wide range of different compromises before settling upon a well-founded –and a more competitive- ship design that reflects the most promising compromise and, as such, will be deemed desirable by its owner. The approach has four key features. Firstly, it uses a novel parametric ship description (based on `packing problems') that can handle large and concurrent changes to the entire three-dimensional ship design, i.e., hull, superstructure, decks, bulkheads and the arrangement of systems in the ship can all change without human interaction. Secondly, it uses a search algorithm to generate a large and diverse set of ship designs that reflect a wide range of different compromises. Thirdly, the naval architect considers all feasible designs to gain insight in conflicting characteristics before selecting the most promising ship designs in a transparent manner. The selection can be based on objective and constraint values, as well as on the naval architect's own engineering judgement. Fourthly, the naval architect takes all selection decisions to help instil the crucial sense of ownership for the ship designs that result from the selection process. This novel design approach has been applied successfully to design two types of service vessels: deep water drillships and frigates. It proved able to establish the design impact of variations in payload and performance requirements. Moreover, the resulting set of designs was subsequently used to illustrate how the naval architect can identify and select designs that excel at particular performances, such as sea-keeping. In summary, the approach is expected to improve the naval architect's ability to identify promising ship designs early on, which should lead to the design of more competitive service vessels.},

abstract = {For monitoring burst events in a kind of reactive wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a multipath routing protocol (MRP) based on dynamic clustering and ant colony optimization (ACO) is proposed.. Such an approach can maximize the network lifetime and reduce the energy consumption. An important attribute of WSNs is their limited power supply, and therefore some metrics (such as energy consumption of communication among nodes, residual energy, path length) were considered as very important criteria while designing routing in the MRP. Firstly, a cluster head (CH) is selected among nodes located in the event area according to some parameters, such as residual energy. Secondly, an improved ACO algorithm is applied in the search for multiple paths between the CH and sink node. Finally, the CH dynamically chooses a route to transmit data with a probability that depends on many path metrics, such as energy consumption. The simulation results show that MRP can prolong the network lifetime, as well as balance of energy consumption among nodes and reduce the average energy consumption effectively.},
